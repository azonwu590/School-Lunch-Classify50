## Summary
- Classify 50 school lunch food types though fine-tuning ImageNet pretrained model under Keras framework with 3GB of training data.
- Use Ensemble learning methods combining Xception and EfficientNetv2L models to achieve test accuracy of 85%.
- Final Top-1 accuracy reaches 85%; Top-5 Accuracy reaches 98.6%. 
- Through data preprocessing, improvements were made on classification performance for similar food types of imbalanced distribution and varying image sizes.
